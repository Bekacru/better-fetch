# Better Fetch

Better Fetch is an advanced fetch wrapper for TypeScript that supports any Standard Schema-compliant validator (like Zod, Valibot, ArkType, etc) for runtime validation and type inference. It features error-as-value handling, pre-defined routes, hooks, plugins and more. Works on the browser, node (version 18+), workers, deno and bun.
