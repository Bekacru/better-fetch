Hooks are functions that are called at different stages of the request lifecycle. 

```ts twoslash title="fetch.ts"
import { createFetch } from "@better-fetch/fetch";

const $fetch = createFetch({
    baseURL: "http://localhost:3000",
    onRequest(context) {
        return context;
    },
    onResponse(context) {
        return context.response
    },
    onError(context) {
    },
    onSuccess(context) {
    },
})

```

## On Request

a callback function that will be called when a request is about to be made. The function will be called with the request context as an argument and it's expected to return the modified request context.

```ts twoslash title="fetch.ts"
import { createFetch } from "@better-fetch/fetch";

const $fetch = createFetch({
    baseURL: "http://localhost:3000",
    onRequest(context) {
        // do something with the context
        return context;
    },
})
```

## On Response

a callback function that will be called when a response is received. The function will be called with the response context which includes the `response` and the `requestContext` as an argument and it's expected to return response.


```ts twoslash title="fetch.ts"
import { createFetch } from "@better-fetch/fetch";

const $fetch = createFetch({
    baseURL: "http://localhost:3000",
    onResponse(context) {        
        // do something with the context
        return context.response // return the response
    },
})
```


## On Success and On Error

on success and on error are callbacks that will be called when a request is successful or when an error occurs. The function will be called with the response context as an argument and it's not expeceted to return anything.

```ts twoslash title="fetch.ts"
import { createFetch } from "@better-fetch/fetch";

const $fetch = createFetch({
    baseURL: "http://localhost:3000",
    onSuccess(context) {
        // do something with the context
    },
    onError(context) {
        // do something with the context
    },
})
```
